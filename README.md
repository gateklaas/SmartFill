# SmartFill – Firefox Add-on

SmartFill is a lightweight Firefox extension that helps you complete forms faster by suggesting text as you type. It
learns from what you’ve entered before—across different websites and input fields—and predicts completions directly in
the input, highlighted for easy acceptance or editing.

No AI. No cloud. Just a simple way to save time and reduce repetitive typing.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Learns from your input – Remembers what you’ve typed before and uses it to suggest completions.
- ⚡ Instant predictions – Suggestions appear inline as selected text in the input field.
- 🌐 Works across sites – Predictions carry over between different forms and websites.
- 🔒 Fully offline – Your data stays local. No tracking. No network requests.
- 🚫 Domain toggle – Enable or disable SmartFill on specific sites as needed.
- 💡 Open source – Transparent, hackable, and yours to improve.
